# DVCS
This repository contains code written in Root which calculates form factors in generalized parton distributions. The project on Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) is based on the [BKM](https://github.com/dbeauch/DVCS/blob/main/BKM%20Formulation.pdf) and [Ji](https://github.com/dbeauch/DVCS/blob/main/Ji%20Formulation.pdf) formulations and used by researchers at Jefferson Lab.
